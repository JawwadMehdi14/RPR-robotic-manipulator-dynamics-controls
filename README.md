# ü§ñ 3-DoF Fixed-Base Robot Manipulator ‚Äî Kinematics, Dynamics & Control

## üìå Overview
This project presents the complete modeling, analysis, and control of a **fixed-base 3 Degrees of Freedom (DoF) robot manipulator**, featuring:
- **Two prismatic joints** (linear motion)
- **One revolute joint** (rotational motion)

Using **MATLAB**, **Simulink**, and the **Robotics Toolbox**, the robot was analyzed for:
- **Kinematics** (forward & inverse)
- **Differential kinematics**
- **Dynamics** (via Lagrange and Newton‚ÄìEuler methods)
- **Control strategies** (joint space & operational space)

The work integrates theoretical modeling with practical simulation to evaluate and compare various controllers under trajectory tracking and force control tasks.
